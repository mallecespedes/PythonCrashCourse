# A function that is part of a class is a method. 
# The init method is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance
#  based on the Dog class. The self parameter is required in the method definition and must come first.
#  It must be included in the definition because when Python calls this method later, the method will 
#  automatically pass the seld argument. It is a reference to the instance itself. 
#  Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class. Variables that are 
#  accessible through instances like this are called attributes.
